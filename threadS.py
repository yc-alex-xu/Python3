# In CPython, the global interpreter lock, or GIL, is
#  a mutex that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. 
# This lock is necessary mainly because CPythonâ€™s memory management is not thread-safe.
#  (However, since the GIL exists, other features have grown to depend on the guarantees that it enforces.)
